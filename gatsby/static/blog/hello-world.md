# Hello World!

This blog post serves as the metaphorical ribbon-cutting of this new (and improved) personal site. Built with React.js, Gatsby, and Netlify, the site is blazing fast, optimized for mobile, and much easier to update and customize. I look forward to posting articles related to projects, new technologies, and more.
